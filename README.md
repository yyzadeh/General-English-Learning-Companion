# **General English Learning Companion (University Edition)**

## **üéì Project Overview**

This is the **initial demonstration version** of an Android application designed specifically to support university students in their **General English** lessons. It serves as a comprehensive, interactive mobile companion to reinforce vocabulary, collocations, grammar, and listening skills required for the course.

The goal of the app is to provide an engaging and portable tool for self-study, allowing students to review, practice, and test their knowledge anywhere, anytime.

## **‚ú® Key Features**

The app is structured around the core components of the General English curriculum:

### **1\. Lesson Content (Vocabulary & Collocations)**

The Lesson section breaks down the course material into manageable units.

* **Words & Definitions:** Access essential vocabulary for each lesson.  
* **Collocations:** Focus on common word groupings to help students sound more natural and fluent.  
* **Progress Tracking:** Students can mark words they have mastered to track their review status.

### **2\. Grammar Reinforcement**

This section provides supplemental grammar explanations and exercises directly related to the topics covered in the General English textbook.

* Clear, concise explanations of challenging structures.  
* Focused examples to illustrate usage in context.

### **3\. Listener Box (Spaced Repetition Review)**

The "Listener Box" implements a **Spaced Repetition System (SRS)** to optimize long-term memory retention for vocabulary.

* **Review:** Words and collocations that need regular practice are automatically cycled through this box.  
* **Efficiency:** The system prioritizes the most difficult terms, making study sessions highly efficient.

### **4\. Quizzes**

Periodic assessments are crucial for gauging comprehension.

* **Modular Quizzes:** A new quiz is generated after every **three lessons** (Lessons 1-3, 4-6, etc.).  
* **Review Metrics:** The Home screen provides a review card showing the student's latest quiz performance (e.g., 40.0% on Quiz 1).

## **üõ† Technology Stack**

* **Platform:** Android (Java/Kotlin)  
* **UI/UX:** Designed with a modern, clear, and engaging dark theme (as seen in screenshots).  
* **Database:** **Firebase Firestore** (Chosen for online, real-time, and scalable data storage).
